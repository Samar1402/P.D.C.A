        "In 1937 the Bihar Cricket Association (BCA) played its first Ranji Trophy match against the Cricket Association of Bengal and Assam at Calcutta and got a first-innings lead. A very creditable achievement indeed, though Bihar lost the match to a far better side. The First Ranji Trophy match was played in Bihar at the Keenan Stadium, Jamshedpur in 1939-40 against the Cricket Association of Bengal. Bihar had to wait till the 23rd of January 1948 to record its first victory when it beat Delhi and District Cricket Association at Keenan Stadium, Jamshedpur. Delhi and District Association had to score 32 runs with 8 wickets and one full day left a register a win. But the glorious uncertainties of cricket, 8 wickets tumbled for 17 runs in less than one hour! In 1959-60 Bihar defeated Bengal to become the East-Zone champion and entered into the semi-final of the Ranji Trophy against Mysore, Bihar had a good chance of winning the match if it had taken a lead in the first innings. The actual scores were Bihar 307 & 146 and Mysore 314.",
